# 3. Website Appearance and Link
- The website has 2 main pages (index.html and contact.html) and their screenshots are below.
- As can be seen in the below live demo link and screenshots, I ultimately went with something like a cork board with paper section, which each explain a part of my portfolio. This helps give a studious and professional look at the same time. 
- <ins>_Here's the GitHub page link for the live demo_</ins>: https://sattyikkundu.github.io/Portfolio-Website-project
- _First_, here's the home page (index.html) which contains sections like 'About Me', 'Featured Project', and 'Full-Stack Web Development Skills" (Note that screenshot is partially cut-out to save space).

- _Second_, here's my Contact page (contact.html) with my contact information. It's currently incomplete, but will be finished in due time.

# 4. Notable Features Summary:
- The header menu is a "floating" menu that always sticks to the top of viewport whenever you scroll up or down.
- The first 3 links in the header menu ('About', 'Projects', and 'Skills') have anchor links which *smoothly* scrolls up or down to the corresponding section. Also, the 'Contact' link navigates to Contact.html as intended. 
- A lot of responsive design css was added to make the website adjust the location of various components like images and buttons to look sensible in mobile devices. I tested the responsiveness for several common viewport widths like 320px, 360px, 480px, 540px, 720px, and etc.
- <ins>_Example#1_</ins>: Below responsive design screenshot shows portrait image move under text of 'About' section for 480px.
![Portfolio_website_screenshort_480px_responsiveness_about_section](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5f5fdc73-e196-4441-a350-74df7906eaee)
- <ins>_Example2_</ins>: This reponsive design example shows the buttons (and images) being placed below description to avoid scrunching. Also, you can see the header menu floating on the top of viewport above the 'Featured Projects' section. Lastly, if you look closely at the sample output image under Project#1, you can see the horizontal scroller being added to make the sample output more readable. 
![Portfolio_website_screenshort_480px_responsiveness_project_buttons](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/19d3815c-144a-4eca-a17e-e53ccb301544)
- The buttons in the 'Featured Project' section are each supposed to link to the corresponding GitHub repository and/or Live Demo (where the project is deployed and active). More buttons will be active as more project are added over time.
- Next notable feature is that icons of common technologies were used to showcase my Full-tech stack familiarties. This clearly looks *_way cooler_* than just writing a boring written list of technologies. See below screenshot:
 ![Portfolio_website_screenshort_tech_icons](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7932740e-9e74-4bed-8ffd-8989fdff33c8)
- Next, I've added a copyright notice at the bottom of both my Home and Contact pages. In the previous screenshot image, you can see the copyright at the bottom.
- Lastly, as shown the the earlier Contact page screenshot, I've currently only added my Github profile link. Other contact-related links like linkedIn profile and email will be added in due time.

# 5. What I Learned and Practiced for this Profile Porfolio Project?
- I put heavy focus on mastering my HTML and CSS skills since they're still foundationally important for webpage structures and visual, even in more advanced applications that also use tools like JavaScript, React, and PostgreSQL database.
- <ins>As demonstrated earlier, I learned and applied many CSS styling techniques throughout the project including</ins>:
  - Adding seamless image pattern to the background
  - Making a floating header menu a user can access anytime.
  - Repeatedly learned to implement and refine my responsive design to look visually apealling regardless of mobile sizes. Google WebDeveloper tools was VERY helpful for this. 
  - Using a nested scroller to fit a large long image under Project#1 under 'Featured Projects' section. 
  - importing helpful external APIs and features, like Google fonts and icons.
  - Creating, styling and linking buttons.
  - and etc.

# 6. Future Changes and Objectives
- While this Porfolio site uses only HTML and CSS, I eventually plan to create a more advanced version of this Portfolio site that incorporates both JavaScript(for greater page interactivness) and React (for no page loading for a smoother experience).
- Futher refinements, as they come, in the HTML and CSS coding for better coding efficiency.
